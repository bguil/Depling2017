# UD_French-Sequoia

This folder contains the data of the corpus **UD_French-Sequoia**, converted to the format described in the Depling 2017 paper
_Enhanced UD Dependencies with Neutralized Diathesis Alternation_.

The input data are taken from the release [r2.0-test](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_French-Sequoia/releases/tag/r2.0-test) of UD_French-Sequoia.
The **Grew** system was used for the conversion.
The rules are available at [gitlab.inria.fr](https://gitlab.inria.fr/grew/UDtoAUD).
