# UD_French

This folder contains the data of the corpus **UD_French**, converted to the format described in the Depling 2017 paper
_Enhanced UD Dependencies with Neutralized Diathesis Alternation_.

The input data are taken from the commit [39c982c](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_French/commit/39c982c0fafd55117dae1fb3658ba8b5998df440) in the dev version of UD_French.
The **Grew** system was used for the conversion.
