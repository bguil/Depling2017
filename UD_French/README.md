# UD_French

This folder contains the data of the corpus **UD_French**, converted to the format described in the Depling 2017 paper
_Enhanced UD Dependencies with Neutralized Diathesis Alternation_.

The input data are taken from the commit [c023706](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_French/commit/c0237068427fe2bf4fe8af1435e3233f48090ca9) in the dev version of UD_French.
The **Grew** system was used for the conversion.
The rules are available at [gitlab.inria.fr](https://gitlab.inria.fr/grew/UDtoAUD).
